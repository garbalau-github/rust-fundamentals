### Rust Tutorial

_Rust_ helps developers write fast software that’s memory-efficient. It’s a modern replacement for languages like C++ or C with a focus on code safety and concise syntax.

### Why Rust?

-   High-level language features without performance penalties
-   Program behaviours can be enforced at compile time
-   Built-in dependency management, similar to NPM
-   Quickly growing ecosystem of libraries
-   Friendly & welcoming community

### Technical Rust Goodies

-   First-class multithreading
-   Type tystem
-   Module system makes code separation simple
-   Adding a dependency is 1 line in config file
-   Tooling: generate docs, lint code, auto format

### Topics Covered
